# RequestIt

RequestIt is a web application made to allow people play songs together. It allows there to be a party owner and can accept/decline songs.
It was made with Spring Boot, Mongo, and Vaadin. Additionally, it has some javascript that connects to spotify and allows web playback.

The idea for this app was inspired by the Nexus Q device by Google, which allowed multiple users to add songs to a shared
queue. However, with the discontinuation of the Nexus Q, I saw an opportunity to create a similar solution that could be
accessed by anyone with a web-enabled device.

The importance of this app lies in its ability to bring people together through the shared love of music, especially in
places like weddings, restaurants, and bars. In these settings, this app can enhance the atmosphere by allowing guests to
collectively curate a playlist and enjoy music together.

In addition, the app can also be used as a tool for team building and collaboration in a remote work environment. Team
members can connect and add songs to a shared queue, fostering a sense of togetherness and collaboration even when working remotely.

Overall, this web app is a unique and innovative way to connect and share music with others. It has the potential to
enhance people's everyday lives by bringing them together through the shared love of music and providing a platform for
connection and collaboration in different settings.
